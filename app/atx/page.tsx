          1. Austin is very proud of its BBQ. So if you like Texas BBQ (think
          Brisket) then that&apos;s a must do. Terry Blacks BBQ on Barton
          Springs La BBQ on Caesar Chavez Franklins (but that&apos;s a long
          multi-hour line - the two above are just as good) Oh, by my house is
          Moreno BBQ which is an upcoming rock star 2. Night Life: The major
          nightlife is going to be 6th street and Rainey St. 6th street is
          divided into 3 sections (West 6th, Dirty, and East 6th). West is more
          clubby, Dirty is ‚Ä¶ well dirty - think the kinds of places you could
          sneak in under age - dollar shots - etc. East is the en vogue area and
          has more cocktails and hipster ish vibe. East 6th has my preferred
          cocktail bar called Whislers - and has an upstairs Mezcal bar. Across
          the street behind Lefty&apos;s is a dedicated Gin bar. East 6th also
          has my favorite ‚Äútwo-stepping bar‚Äù called White Horse that has Whiskey
          on tap as well. Rainey - is starting to fall out of my favor as it
          becomes condo heavy. But people still remember it as a cool place.
          There is a fun dive bar up on 11th called Nickel City that could be a
          fun post-music stop. since its in-between the two destinations. 3.
          Nature: Number one is my heart is Barton Springs. If y&apos;all
          brought swimming&apos; suits and the weather is hot enough - I
          absolutely recommend a trip here. It&apos;s a natural spring fed pool
          that is 68 degrees year round. You go and bask in the texas heat, then
          take a dip in the chilly waters. It&apos;s a huge lay on the grass
          situation. (No food or drinks allowed besides water to help keep pests
          out) After wards the move is to and get trashy food. This is a good
          recovery day. Options include Pool Burger, Matt&apos;s El Rancho, or
          if you are really feeling your college days going to Baby A&apos;s and
          getting shit housed on ‚ÄúPurps‚Äù (an ever clear based purple sugar
          ‚Äúmargarita‚Äù) also the Green Belt hikes are a strong move if you want
          to get between 1-4 miles of walking in surrounded by trees and if we
          have had enough water, some running water too. Plenty of entrances and
          google can help you. Also, the Town Lake trail - it&apos;s a 2-6 mile
          hike and bike trail around the ‚Äúlake‚Äù in the center of the city. I say
          ‚Äúlake‚Äù because it&apos;s damned up river. üòâ and it looks like a
          river. Tons of people will be out on the trail so it can be a fun
          time. Vibing with the College kids? ‚Ä¶ Austin is the Home to the great
          University of Texas which has a huge campus and a neat vibe. If you
          want to walk around college kids or if you want to get some UT gear
          for a fan back home, I recommend going to the ‚ÄúCo Op‚Äù (a three story
          store dedicated to all things burnt orange) on Guadalupe. From there
          you can easily walk around check the scene. Now since you are used to
          really good beef, if you are looking for a good night out with high
          quality meat I would recommend Jacoby&apos;s on Caesar Chavez. If you
          want Sushi - I recommend Uchi, Fukumoto, or Neighborhood Sushi. High
          End Mexican food: ATX Cocina Middle End Mexican Food: De Nada Cantina
          - get the pink cup Margs but be warned‚Ä¶. If you want a solid Tex-Mex
          hit - Matt&apos;s El Rancho - the Knockout Margaritas and ‚ÄúThe Bob‚Äù
          queso. Austin is also a huge fan of breakfast tacos. You can pretty
          much throw a rock and hit a place serving them. Brunch: Little Darlin
          - near me - also good for dinners. A former motorcyclist bar taken
          over by hipsters (Yellow Jacket Social Club is the same kind of vibe)
          Paper Boy (upscale) - if you can get it - that place is busy AF Fresas
          on South 1st - strong mexican food location in a hip part of town.
          Murals: Austin has a few murals - but the best one is to get a picture
          taken in front of the ‚ÄúI Love you So Much‚Äù mural on South Congress.
          Also, South Congress is a great place to park and walk up and down the
          street. Lot&apos;s of food options and people watching is A+.
          ‚Ä¶pausing‚Ä¶ let me know if I missed anything you were thinking of.
          Breweries: PHP (Pint House Pizza): Get the Electric Jellyfish (a hazy
          IPA that&apos;s all the rage) Meanwhile Brewery: A bit further East
          St. Elmo Brewery - in an up and coming little spot. Has a great food
          truck called Spicy Boys - It&apos;s also right next to Still Austin
          for local spirits. In the St. Elmo place is also a winery. Just down
          the ‚Äúblock‚Äù Groceries - near my house: 1. Central Market - upscale HEB
          grocery store with a limited selection but great produce and an
          interesting ‚Äúmaze like‚Äù layout. Def not what you see every day. 2. HEB
          - here is another thing that Texans will brag about until the cows
          come home. Their love of HEB. This is your one stop shop grocery store
          (Where CM will be missing odds and ends like not $1,000 toilet paper).
          This feels and looks like a normal store, they just tend to be a bit
          bigger and because we are in texas the produce is üíØ 3. Sprouts also
          close - hipster grocery - can be hit and miss on general items but if
          you need an organic GMO free, blessed by the fairies at night shaker
          of salt. They got you fam. Don&apos;t Do: I don&apos;t recommend the
          Randalls that is close to me.
