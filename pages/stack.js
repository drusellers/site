        I'm a productivity wonk. I have been for a very long time. I would track
        every commitment in Outlook even while in college. My calendar was a

        book and I vaccummed it up like it was honey straight from the hive. I
        also have a variety of friends that are like minded and from time to
        time we will share with each other our "setup" in the hopes of
        uncovering something new and novel that we haven't tried yet (oh!
        Shiney!) or simply learning something new that we hadn't thought of
        before. Over time various items will stick around more than others which
        tend to be our goto items. This page is an attempt to provide what is
        working for me as of the last updated time, and ideally why am I using
        that?

      <h2>Foundation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Sleep</strong> I try to get 8-9 hours every night. Even when I
          get up at 5am to go to the gym
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Exercise</strong> removes stress and helps me to stay healthy
          and on task. This is also a bootstrapper for me of other valuable
          habits. Get up on time, invest in my health, and then set the path for
          the rest of the day.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mental Floss</strong> I actively engage a therapist to work
          through my own mental baggage, this is an investment in myself and it
          lets me see the world with out as much of my own shit sandwhich
          applied to it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Meditation</strong> I haven't gotten to 30 or 60 min each day,
          but I do spend 5-10 min each day just sitting
          [zazen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zazen) trying to clear my mind
          out. My key benefit I'm focusing on is self control of where my mind
          is going, letting go of the "monkey mind".
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Food Prep</strong> this is a part of falling into the pit of
          success, if I make it easy to do the right thing then doing the right
          thing becomes easy. Making food ahead of time saves me from the
          sleepies by having nutritious food that keeps me on track and means I
          can ultimately spend less time in the gym.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Processes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Getting Things Done</strong> this is a book that describes a
          process for plowing through your work and making sure that your are
          actually moving forward. It is my current foundation for working
          through my day when I'm mentally and emotionally healthy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>43 Folders</strong>: While archaic in this time, its useful to
          me to remember I used to have 43 folders for remembering to do things,
          31 for each day of the month + 12 for each month. I would place
          physical reminders to process something in the correct folder and
          would do so each day. There is a power in the physical tokens, that I
          try to not lose sight of.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sunday Reflections</strong>: on Sundays I spend my mornings by
          reviewing both personal and work commitments and thinking about the
          impact of those commitments on the upcoming week. This can take
          anywhere from 1 to 2 cups of coffee.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Note Compaction</strong>: I carry with me a spiral notebook
          named `/dev/null` where I iterate on a million ideas. This is a
          scratch pad of notes, ideas, todo lists, and anything else that I can
          jot down. This in some form or another has been with me for a long,
          long time and is the back bone of my process. Once every other week or
          two I go through the entire thing from front to back and rip out the
          trash/one-off notes. If I find a good note or idea that gets promotted
          to a more permanent location. Location one is that it feels like a big
          part of me and gets migrated to my "book" that I'm hypothetically
          writing but what this really is, is a place for long form ideas to
          mature and grow. Sometimes I put a few sentences, sometimes a few
          pages. But each time I visit it, it gets enriched in some form or
          another. It could end up here on my site if I have a coherent enough
          thought to share, which is rare right now. It could end up as a
          detailed note in Evernote, which is fading away in importance as I
          embrace other tools for secrets, and long form ideas. Sharing Evernote
          note's just isn't the experience that I want.

          <strong>1-3-1</strong> This is a weekly reflection technique that a
          mentor taught me. The goal is to start the week with one big question
          that you want to ask, define/declare three intentions to be completed
          in the week, and then what is one strength you want to work on. I have
          a spreadsheet that tracks these for each week and I have space to
          reflect on last weeks entry.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mirror Notes</strong> until I find a better system, i find
          leaving myself long term goal notes on my mirror with Dry Marker to be
          a highly effective tool for keeping my eye on the ball even when that
          ball is months or years away.

        Wish list - how can I build a process that reinforces my existing habits
        and commitments. I keep wanting something that juts works on my Apple
        Watch but I haven't found anything nor have i really invested the time
        into it. I would also love something that could some how be embedded
        into my desktop background. The ever present information radiator is the
        dream. It should be subtle and ever present.

      <h2>Tools</h2>
      <strong>Mac</strong> when I started the foundational tool that I expected
      when I started, but now I have a hard time imagining alternatives, and
      moving to Ubuntu pulls at a lot of developer heart strings for me but I
      can't see my self being as productive sadly. - <strong>iCloud</strong>{" "}
      makes backups just work across iPad, iPhone, and Mac. This is a pretty big
      form of "lock in" but I'm not expecting to migrate _any time soon._ I've
      cancelled Dropbox because it just doesn't have a compelling offering over
      iCloud for me (although I really like Paper and use that at work
      extensively). - <strong>Mulitple Desktops:</strong> a small feature that
      other OS's have, but it was the first implementation that just worked for
      me.
      <strong>One Big Monitor</strong> i used to be a big double monitor kid,
      but now-a-days with 5k monitors I find that one is enough and using a
      window manager type tool really helps me stay focused.
      <strong>3 subject spiral binder</strong> my go to quick note taking
      device. `/dev/null` from note compaction. This way I don't have to have a
      computer open to take notes which leads to distractions (for me)
      <strong>Hemi Sync Music</strong> this may sound odd but something about
      working to music by [Hemi-Sync](https://hemi-sync.com) has a net positive
      effect for me. Placebo or not.
      <strong>Caffiene</strong> true fact, nuff said

          <strong>Superhuman</strong> for email. I like having a dedicated app
          for things so that I can `CMD+TAB` to the app i want or use my window
          manager. Can't do that with Google or Firefox tabs

          <strong>Fantastical 2</strong> not a huge game changer here, this
          entry is still contested

          <strong>Evernote</strong> this is slowly dieing off as I move content
          to either my gitbook hosted system or 1Password for secure things but
          its image capture of notes is still one of the best
