## Literal

One aspect that comes up a lot is that I'm pretty literal and pedantic about words. 
Please know that this comes from a place where I'm trying to understand you, having
worked in computers for over 20 years, I've learned that there can be a lot of
hidden meaning in words and I'll often try to work to understand your word choices.

## Push

I will push hard for what I want, in an effort to be clear. But I like
to think that I&apos;m still open to changes even in this state.
