If you are also a bit of a productity nerd, then let this page be a window into my current process and flow.

## History

My journey into this started when I was in college, I'm not sure why this behavior started, but I recall being very dillegent about printing out my weekly calendar from Outlook. I remember, finding something comforting about the printed form, that I would put in the cover of a three-ring binder and carry it around with me. Transferring items from the paper to the digital. There is something tactile about that time that is missing today, but I don't really have a solution. 

I was a fan of
[43 folders](http://www.43folders.com) back in the day, I've
been in love with wikis (c2wiki, tidlywiki, etc.) I loved Stephen
Covey's 7 habits. Because of this inclination, I was primed when David Allen
dropped his [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280)
book and I vaccummed it up like it was honey straight from the hive.

I also have a variety of friends that are like minded and from time to
time we will share with each other our "setup" in the hopes of
uncovering something new and novel that we haven't tried yet (Oh, shiny!) or simply learning something new that we hadn't thought of
before. Over time various items have stuck around longer than others which tend to be our goto items. This page is an attempt to provide what is
working for me as of the last updated time, and ideally why am I using
that?

## Foundation

The boring stuff, that absolutely moves the biggest boulders possible.

- **Sleep** 8-9hrs every night. I may be a bit boring at night, as I'm often starting to fade pretty hard, but this habit has allowed me to operate at my highest levels either in the office or in the gym. 

-
  **Exercise** removes stress and helps me to stay healthy
  and on task. This is also a bootstrapper for me of other valuable
  habits. Get up on time, invest in my health, and then set the path for the rest of the day.
-
  **Mental Floss** I actively engage a therapist to work
  through my own mental baggage, this is an investment in myself and it lets me see the world with out as much of my own shit sandwich
  applied to it.
-
  **Meditation** I haven't gotten to 30 or 60 min each day,
  but I do spend 5-10 min each day just sitting
  [zazen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zazen) trying to clear my mind
  out. The key benefit I'm focusing on is self-control of where my mind is going, and letting go of the "monkey mind".
-
  **Food Prep** this is a part of falling into the pit of
  success, if I make it easy to do the right thing then doing the right thing becomes easy. Making food ahead of time saves me from the sleepies by having nutritious food that keeps me on track and means I can ultimately spend less time in the gym.

- **Simplify** we live in a world where its possible to do some many things. Whenever I can, I seek to simplify and remove from my life. The goal being to get to the core experience, so that I can say "yes" to awesome things, and "no" to those that don't bring value.

## Processes

-
  **Getting Things Done**: this is a book that describes a
  process for plowing through your work and making sure that you are
  actually moving forward. It is my current foundation for working
  through my day when I'm mentally and emotionally healthy.
-
  **43 Folders**: I used to have 43 folders for remembering to do things,
  31 for each day of the month + 12 for each month. I would place
  physical reminders to process something in the correct folder and
  would do so each day. There is a power in the physical tokens, that I
  try to not lose sight of.
-
  **Sunday Reflections**: I spend my Sunday mornings
  reviewing both personal and work commitments and thinking about the
  impact of those commitments on the upcoming week. This can take
  anywhere from 1 to 2 cups of coffee.
-
  **1-3-1**: This is a weekly reflection technique that a
  mentor taught me. The goal is to start the week with one big question
  that you want to ask, define/declare three intentions to be completed
  in the week, and then what is one strength you want to work on. I have
  a spreadsheet that tracks these for each week and I have space to
  reflect on last weeks entry.
-
  **Mirror Notes**: until I find a better system, i find
  leaving myself long term goal notes on my mirror with Dry Marker to be
  a highly effective tool for keeping my eye on the ball even when that
  ball is months or years away.

> Wish list - how can I build a process that reinforces my existing habits
and commitments. I keep wanting something that just works on my Apple
Watch but I haven't found anything nor have I really invested the time
into it. I would also love something that could some how be embedded
into my desktop background. The ever present information radiator is the dream. It should be subtle and ever present.

## Note Compaction

The idea is that I have an evolutionary system for notes and ideas. At each step of an idea, it will be challenged and if it passes the "test" it will move on to the next location.

This seems to be a somewhat unique process that I go through. I have multiple ways to collect notes, but the goal is to get everything into one inbox (ala GTD). More often than not, it goes into my `/dev/null` notebook.

> The phrase `/dev/null` comes from computing on Linux platforms, and represents a file that you can write to, that just disappears, you are literally writing into the void.

It all starts in a three of five subject notebook that I carry around labeled `/dev/null`. I will write any and everything down here first, I'll go through page after page of ideas, scribbles, and sketches. Sometimes, that's all I need to unblock me or that's as long as an idea needs to exist.

Around once a week, I'll cull my notes, by going through old pages and ripping out what is now trash, and then hand copying the things that need to stay into new pages. This process usually sees me refining the ideas, adding more content, or otherwise simply processing the idea. The work of recopying the notes is the "bar" I use to help kill useless ideas or to get them over the finish line.

When the notebook gets filled up, this compaction process begins anew, where I copy notes from the old notebook into the new notebook. Sometimes, the ideas are more of a long lived idea, a touch stone. At this point, these notes will get promoted to a longer term storage. For personal stuff this is my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notebook, and for work related stuff this is my [Slab](https://slab.com/) wiki.

## Tools

- **Mac** when I started the foundational tool that I expected
when I started, but now I have a hard time imagining alternatives, and
moving to Ubuntu pulls at a lot of developer heart strings for me but I can't see my self being as productive sadly. 
- **iCloud**  makes backups just work across iPad, iPhone, and Mac. This is a pretty big form of "lock in" but I'm not expecting to migrate _any time soon._ I've cancelled Dropbox because it just doesn't have a compelling offering over iCloud for me (although I really like Paper and use that at work
extensively). 
  - **Mulitple Desktops:** a small feature that
  other OS's have, but it was the first implementation that just worked for
  me.

- **One Big Monitor**: I used to be a big double monitor kid,
but now-a-days with 5k monitors I find that one is enough and using a
window manager type tool really helps me stay focused.

- **Caffeine**: This is a tool that I probably abuse more than I really use. I'm usually using 1-2 cups of undiluted cold brew each day. My current flavor of choice is the [Onyx Cold Brew](https://onyxcoffeelab.com/products/cold-brew?variant=31888816078946) blend.

## Key Tools

- **Email** I'm currently in the Google Apps domain. It's not my favorite for personal work, but it works well with my preferred email app Superhuman.
- **1Password** I manage all of my passwords in 1Password, and also include a variety of secret notes in this tool as well. For personal use, I like the user interface, I like the search, and I really like the various sharing options when I need to collobarate with family members that both do and don't have 1Password.
- **iMessages** this just works between iPad, iPhone, and my Mac. No _bs_ just works.
  - If I needed to be more cross platform I would look at [Signal](https://signal.org/)

## Minor Tools

- **Things**: A todo list manager. The key feature for me is the ease of adding new things.
- **Superhuman**: for email. I like having a dedicated app for things so that I can `CMD+TAB` to the app i want or use my window  manager. Can't do that with Google or Firefox tabs
- **Fantastical 2** not a huge game changer here, this
entry is still contested. I'm currently falling in love with **Cron**, but I can't say that it is a major game changer. The key feature is that Cron will sync my meetings across calendars allowing me to better utilize tools like SavvyCal.
- **Obsidian**: Note taking
  - **Evernote** this is slowly dieing off as I move content to either my gitbook hosted system or 1Password for secure things but its image capture of notes is still one of the best
- **Bartender** This application helps me manage my MacOS menu bar
- **Paper** The Mac drawing app (not Dropbox Paper)
- **[Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/)** hot key manager utilized with [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) for window management. I'm interested in possible shopping for a for-fee option so that I know the tool would be evolved. I may look at [Rectange](https://rectangleapp.com/) at some point.

- **Toggl** this is a for fee service, that I use to track my time. I'm working on getting better at managing my time, since its so easy to waste.
