## Primum Vir Esto

_First, be a man._

This is the motto of my Alma Mater and my Fraternity and I have adopted it as my
  personal motto as well. I will strive always to act as the ideal
  of a Man. Someone who looks out for others and protects them. To judge
  a man in terms of being a human. To be compassionate and caring of
  others
