# VP of Operations

Automated the existing manual business process that provisioned new clusters for OMC's customers. This required an in-depth understanding of the entire OMC platform across the entire lifecycle of a search cluster. This included various cloud resources, networking architecture, Linux OS, SystemD, Elasticsearch, and Solr. The solution was built in Java and PostgreSQL which together orchestrated the provisioning of all cloud resources. The solution successfully decreased deployment times from 2 business days to 5 minutes, and become a fulcrum for increased platform capabilities.

The system was later extended to support multiple cloud providers, as well as a means to deploy the OMC platform inside of Enterprise tier customer's cloud accounts.

I joined all sales calls as the solution architect, using my understanding of our platform, and the target Cloud's resources to perform instance sizing purpose fit for our customers. This constant involvement with Head of Sales in the sales process lead to further optimizations in the OMC platform that simplified the entire sales process. Once a deal was closed, I would then transition into the solution engineer to bring the customer's request to life. I would gather the needed network and cloud information to then provision the clusters. I would work with the onboarding customer's team to get connectivty up and running. Often in a matter of days.

With my previous experience working in a Federally regulated bank, and my knowledge of the entire OMC platform I was also responsible for all security related questions. I would work closely with the CTO and Head of Sales to answer these questionaires, and as I found common gaps, I would correct them through the deployment of new software, or developing new internal processes. This included an annual security training, improved documentation in standard operating procedures, our first 3rd party security assessment and culminated in leading the company's SOC 2 Type II certification.

# COO

Given my thorough understanding of the entire OMC platform, and my education in business it became a natural next step for me to expand my roles and responsibilities. 

With all of the calls and work I was doing with Sales, I started to expand my leadership by working with outside counsel on contract negotiations, with makerting to try and identify more compelling messaging that would help sales, and the biggest item was participating in a complete restructuring our our pricing tables based on our increased growth from the platform improvements.

Expanded platform support by hiring more engineers, including our first international hire in Australia, so that OMC could provide support outside of American working hours. The addition of new staff drove an increase in our standard operating procedures, which dramatically improved our internal documentation, and was embedded deeply into our alerting and notification systems.

In the area of Finance, I helped OMC migrate their GL practices to a modern accounting firm. Helped to restructure the Chart of Accounts and installed a monthly review process to help make sure the company was growing and managing its expenses. I participated in the annual 409A process, the budgeting process, and FP&A activities.

In the area of Business Operations, I worked closely with Director of Operations to expand our documentation process into areas outside of the Platform, including Accounting, Human Resources, and Payroll. Together we also expanded the company's ability to take on HIPAA customers and developed the needed processes to support the GDPR requirements for our EU customers.
