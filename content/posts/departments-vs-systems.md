Departments exist to group and manage people.

Value chains and systems exist to provide value

The friction of department organization and value chain organization

My purpose in discussing this centers around how we build out our software systems. Its no secret that companies are racing to further automate their systems and processes. But budgets are controlled by departments. Departments exist to manage people, and the heads of each department can be changed as needed across time. Even with this change, the business processes rarely change.
