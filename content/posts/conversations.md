              The power is in the conversation, not the tool.
---

After this most recent conference about Wardley Map's I was reminded that the
power in the "tool" is in the conversations it enables. The power of the
"Stand up" is that we can all talk about what we are doing. The power of the
whiteboard is that we can all stand around and visualize together. The power
of the "Cynefin" framework is the language it gives us to communicate about
something. Without anyone to talk to or share this with there is no point.

We don't map for the sake of mapping. We don't document for the sake of
documenting, we do it so we can communicate. Ideally, we find ways to increase
our communication throughput. Because, we all come to the table with a different
context. We come to the table with different problems, different pains,
and different goals.
