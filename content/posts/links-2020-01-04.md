              A few links from Jan 04, 2020

Here is a recent link dump of articles that I've found and read.

# Svelte

So, I can't recall I how I got here, but I ended up watching a talk by Rich Harris about "Rethinking Reactivity". This talk Rich talks about React, how the current Shadow DOM model is inherently slow, and how his tool Svelte takes a different approach. Being a huge fan of compiled languages, I naturally like what Rich has to say. Use a compiler to write a better "framework." On top of it all, its just a damn well put together presentation.

- The Talk: https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-3-rethinking-reactivity
- https://sapper.svelte.dev/ - a server side rendered (SSR) version of Svelte
- While watching the talk became aware of https://observablehq.com/ which I'll be playing with over the coming weeks. My question is: Is this an easier to use [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)?

# Corey Quinn

I generally really like what Corey (of [Last Week in AWS](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/) fame) has to say, and in this podcast he reviews and discusses the complexity of cloud based pricing. I ended up writing about a page of idea to take back to my [company](https://bonsai.io) to help further streamline our own pricing and tracking.

# Ruby Gains Pattern Matching

I'm a big fan of a programming feature called "pattern matching". I've often missed pattern matching in ruby after fresh dive into Rust, F#, clojure, or any other language that has this feature. Work is largely a ruby shop so this upcoming release is looking to be a fun update for me.
