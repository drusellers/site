  What I learned working on ERP and a 3PL and a SaaS Cloud

A request for services is a "Sales Order" [^1]

Once completed that turns into an Invoice which is recorded in the G/L Accounts Receivable

Every month we issue a new invoice for the upcoming month (This is an ERP function)

When a customer cancels a plan we should make a "cancellation" entry we shouldn't mutate existing data

When a customer upgrades we can make a "refund" entry + the new plan entry. This way we don't mutate and SQL aggregate methods will work just fine.

[^1]: The note
