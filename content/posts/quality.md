  Quality is a lazy word. Be better.

# Asking for a quality product, is a lazy ask.

> Because they know all they sold ya was a guaranteed piece of shit. That's all it is, isn't it? Hey, if you want me to take a dump in a box and mark it guaranteed, I will. I got spare time. But for now, for your customer's sake, for your daughter's sake, ya might wanna think about buying a quality product from me.

I can’t stand it when someone asks for something “high quality” or “clean” or some other vague, meaningless adjective. 
It drives me nuts—not because I don’t care about quality, but because they haven’t done the work to define what they 
actually want. This pet peeve has only grown as I’ve tried to get better at my own requests—whether it’s working with 
tattoo artists or designers on a website. Describing what you want is hard, sure. But that’s no excuse for being lazy 
about it. You don’t need perfect language—you just need to try harder than “make it good.”

I think that this irk, was born when I was taught that Quality isn’t a single attribute—it’s contextual. In engineering,
we often talk about the “-ilities”: reliability, scalability, usability, maintainability, and so on. These are different 
dimensions of quality, and which ones matter most depends entirely on context. A high-quality dinner table isn’t judged 
by the same criteria as a high-quality workbench. One might prioritize finish and aesthetics; the other, durability and 
load-bearing strength. The same holds true for systems and teams. The measurements we use to define and improve quality
need to reflect the environment we’re operating in and the purpose the system is meant to serve.

Another way this shows up is when a random company in 2025 says that there are going to build a world class datacenter.
It's almost hard for me to keep a straight face. Yeah, you are going to build a "wOrlD cLAss DaTa CentEr" with your 
team of 3 engineers, in the matter of twelve months. I'm talking they are going to build this on prem. The disconnect
from reality about what world-class actually is, is comical. I have no problem with building the best that we can build
but a team of three is not going to build anything world class. And that is fine, there is no problem with making something
good enough, let's just be above board about what it is.

## A Better Way

Ok, enough of my complaining.

### Visual Items

- Build a pinterest board, collect a variety of images and put them all together.
- Even better, is to then annotate those images with what you like and don't like about those images
    - Sometimes saying what you don't want can be more powerful for the artist
- Write up a paragraph or two about what you want to acheive with the images

### Software

- understand the scale of what you are building
    - how many times per day is this going to happen
- understand the business processes that you want to automate
- document them, define them as an SOP that a human could do, then it will be so much easier to automate


## Closing

In the end, do the work ahead of time to define what you want. Explore how the world describes these things.
Mimic these things. Write them down, use a tool to convert your spoken word into text. Use AI to convert your 
ideas into text. 

JUST. DO. THE. WORK.
