  A few brief thoughts on implementing agile in your department

## Thoughts on implementing agile in your department

The basic idea is that implementing agile inside of a non-agile organization will lead to friction
for those implementing agile. I'm specifically thinking about the ideas from the field of 
cybernetics (not Robocop, but the more academic field concerned with the way systems work).

If we don't look at the system that contains our system, then we can set ourselves up for failure. If
you are discussing a systemic change in your engineering department, but don't look at the behavior and
systems of your company you could build up negatively loop that is ultimately fighting against you.

To that end, I recommend asking some hard questions about the cadence of the existing business and 
how an iterative style could fit inside of the existing business processes.
