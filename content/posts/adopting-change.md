              Why do novel changes to existing practices drive me crazy?
---

One thing that I've been learning about myself at this conference is that when
people change or adapt an existing tool to better fit their needs, this gives
me fits. I get arrogant about it, as if I know the one true way and that this
true understanding is some how better than the method they are using. Its
as if my experience of life is more true than theirs. If there is anything
that I have learned from studying the Buhdist principles is that this is just
flat... out... wrong. I am wrong.

I'm not sure where this attitude comes from inside of me, but it has been there
for a long time. I have always been the "rules lawyer" in my friend circles.

In the end I need to let these feelings go, and instead seek to learn from their
experiences. Leverage their flexibility, as a way to find new value in the same
way that they may find value in the depth of understanding that I seek to acquire.
