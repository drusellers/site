## Brand Introduction

Serious

I tend to like [Simple.com's](https://simple.com) brand. Clean whites with a bit of color

Openness, Empathy, Experience, Emotion

The balance of warm and cool - not just cool
Balance Masculine images with feminine colors?

- Lotus Flower SVG
- Flat Irons SVG

The balance of masculine and feminine is particularly interesting to me.

## Words

- Tattoos - edgey
- Business - let's make money
- deadlifts - heavy, hard, big boy/girl shit
- code - intellect, thoughtfulness, optimization

## Design

Should feel like a scholarly article: mimic scholarly layouts.

Should blend in some commerce: Use a guilloche pattern to bring in a variety of subtle colors. A guilloche pattern of 1's and 0's that's pretty fine like the idea of "micro-print" on currency. You have to "zoom" to some extent to see it. Its subtle, like weaving money and techology. I would love to have it in SVG so I would easily swap colors to fit with the brand.


# 1. Fonts

Headers: Helvetica - when i see this in bold headers it really feels like the standard white paper. I'm ok with that. I'll spend my "fun" elsewhere.

Body Copy: Helvetica - same, same

# 1. Colors

Blues / Blacks - Blue is a core part of the internet. Links are blue. While the OG blue is a bit too dark for me I want to maintain that history of blue links. So, blue should be an accent color in some ways at least.

But shouldn't shy away from Pinks

Always like the idea of finding a way to work femine colors in. What is the femine version of serious? I feel like the blues of IBM, dark tones are what makes a manly color serious.

How could you do a "Dark Mode" that wasn't black? Purples? Navy? Greens.

# 2.  Taglines

Curiosity is life.

Fusing Business and Technology

Weaving Business and Technology

# 2. Urls

Prefer `-` (dashes) to `_` (underscores)


# 3. Page Structures

1/3 text - 2/3 image? (print media me thinks)
