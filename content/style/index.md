## Brand Introduction

Serious

I tend to like Simple.com's brand. Clean whites with a bit of color

Openness, Empathy, Experience, Emotion

The balance of warm and cool - not just cool

Tattoos and Business and Deadlifts and Code

Balance Masculine images with feminine colors?

- Lotus Flower SVG
- Flat Irons SVG


## Design

Should feel like a scholarly article: mimic scholarly layouts.

Should blend in some commerce: Use a guilloche pattern to bring in a variety of subtle colors. A guilloche pattern of 1's and 0's that's pretty fine like the idea of "micro-print" on currency. You have to "zoom" to some extent to see it. Its subtle, like weaving money and techology. I would love to have it in SVG so I would easily swap colors to fit with the brand.


# 1. Fonts

Headers: Helvetica - when i see this in bold headers it really feels like the standard white paper. I'm ok with that. I'll spend my "fun" elsewhere.

Body Copy: Helvetica - same, same

# 1. Colors

Blues / Blacks

But shouldn't shy away from Pinks

Always like the idea of finding a way to work femine colors in. What is the femine version of serious? I feel like the blues of IBM, dark tones are what makes a manly serious.

How could you do a "Dark Mode" that wasn't black? Purples? Navy? Greens.

# 2.  Taglines

Fusing Business and Technology

Weaving Business and Technology

## 1.1 Brand Colors

# 2. Urls

Prefer `-` (dashes) to `_` (underscores)


# 3. Page Structures

1/3 text - 2/3 image? (print media me thinks)

# 4. Do's and Dont's

Words we do like / Words we don't like
