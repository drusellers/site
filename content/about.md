Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dru Sellers, and I'm a technologist that is also passionate about
the design and operations of a business. I originally went to college to study 
business because, as my Dad said, "everyone needs business people." 

While in school I randomly took a 9 week HTML class to fulfill some technology
credits, and after **bolding** my name in the browser I absolutely lost my mind.
I went back to the dorms, that night and started building my web page. I don't recall
getting dinner, after who knows how many can's of Mountain Dew I found GeoCities and
uploaded my gif laden, under-construction, single page website with the amazingly 
clever background color  {% chip color="#123456" /%} `#123456` _(its a dark slate blue)_.

The next class, I hurriedly walk into class and proudly showed my professor what I had done
over the last two days at which point my professor let me know that I was done with the class.
I had completed the whole class in two days of self-directed caffeine induced learning.

I can't overstate how powerful that moment was. I had taken a kernel of understanding, 
and been able to flesh out a significantly deeper understanding through my own drive.
My perspective on what I could teach myself was forever changed. 

After college I started to work at a small start up, I was the only programmer working on
a web application. I wrote the program in a true isolation from other humans, beyond what I could 
read and find on the internet. It was then that I found open source software (OSS), and I ran
into a community of programmers from across the world that (while blunt at times) were more
than happy to share their thoughts and opinions. These _"strangers"_, who I would eventually meet
in person, elevated my programming from intern to senior engineer in a crucible of fire. They did
not hold back, as many of us have experienced with online communities. It was my passion to create
something that would earn me a tiny morsel "street cred" that allowed me to get lost in the
passion trying to create something.

During this time, I was reading books on software design non-stop while my significant other was 
studying law. One of the many books I read was David West's [Object Thinking](https://www.amazon.com/Object-Thinking-Developer-Reference-David-ebook/dp/B00JDMPOKM/ref=sr_1_1), which made a connection
to the Platonic ideal, which was a topic I had studied in college philosophy. There was something about
that connection that reasonated deeply with me. It was around this time, that I started to really link
my software modeling to the way we would model businesses in school. This connected my two fields of
understanding in a way that unlocked a new approach to software design/thinking.

For the last {% $years %}, I have combined these twin passions in a way that has created a valuable
mental model to solving problems for a business. This website is my poor attempt to catalog my ideas
and models so that others can hopefully build off of my labors.
