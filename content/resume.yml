            This customer later ended up migrating to a new ERP, and we were able to maintain the existing
            system, on the old ERP, and transitioned to the new ERP with no downtime while continuing to ship
            new functionality at the same time. We also added on another API client that needed to help expose
            customer quotes in their Adobe Commerce Edge implementation.
        bullets:
          - Led zero-downtime migration between ERP systems while maintaining feature delivery
          - Designed API abstractions to decouple front-end and ERP dependencies
          - Enabled parallel operation of legacy and new systems during transition

            Building on the success of the digital sinage project, we developed a new streamlined ERP front end 
            in Nuxt.js for Showroom sales staff that integrated with Entra ID. To accomplish this we extended the
            previous API to include their ERP, and Bloomreach Customer outreach tooling.
        bullets:
          - Designed Nuxt.js front-end integrated with Entra ID and Bloomreach
          - Extended core APIs to support new ERP workflows

            Rehabilitated an existing Vue.js, Couchbase, on-prem digital signage application that experienced
            extended down times, and inaccurate information. We converted it to a .NET API, with 
            a Nuxt.js front-end. This allowed us to quickly bring the application to a point where new 
            features could be deployed.
        bullets:
          - Re-architected unstable on-prem system into .NET API + Nuxt front-end
          - Reduced downtime and restored data accuracy
          - Established foundation for future feature development

            I embarked on this journey to try and get a different perspective on the
            software development lifecycle. Being the one that has to make the large
            and sometimes boring decisions. How will that impact the company's bottom
            line? What all do we REALLY need? Its was a great process of exploring
            and understanding all aspects of running a business.

            while still meeting the business’ need for applications to be delivered. As a staff
            position I had to provide a business value reason for most of my recommendations,
