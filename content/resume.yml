          This customer later ended up migrating to a new ERP, and we were able to maintain the existing
          system, on the old ERP, and transitioned to the new ERP with no downtime while continuing to ship
          new functionality at the same time. We also added on another API client that needed to help expose
          customer quotes in their Adobe Commerce Edge implementation.

            Building on the success of the digital sinage project, we developed a new streamlined ERP front end 
            in Nuxt.js for Showroom sales staff that integrated with Entra ID. To accomplish this we extended the
            previous API to include their ERP, and Bloomreach Customer outreach tooling.

            Rehabilitated an existing Vue.js, Couchbase, on-prem digital signage application that experienced
            extended down times, and inaccurate information. We converted it to a .NET API, with 
            a Nuxt.js front-end. This allowed us to quickly bring the application to a point where new 
            features could be deployed.

            Working closely with the CEO and Head of Sales we developed a pricing model that allowed 
            us to take advantage of our new automated provisioning process leading to a better understanding
            of our cost model, and our customers needs.
          - >
            Worked closely with the Head of Sales to build out a unique product offering
            that would help companies better manage their search infrastructure. In the process
            of working with the Head of Sales we were able to increase the average deal size
            from $500/mth to $8,000/mth
          - > 
            Worked closely with the CEO to explore various modern ways to run a business including
            the deployment of a 4 day work week, aggressively limiting the number of meetings and 
            exploring options for async communication.

            I choose this opportunity because it would allow me to explore a position
            in a company's leadership. For years I've been reading books on business
            strategy and leadership. I was now in a position to both exercise that
            knowledge and realize just how much I had to learn.
          - >
            The first task was to automate the process of provisioning our customer's clusters.
            The project successfully reduced the time for custom clusters from two days to 15 minutes.
          - >
            Building on that success, we leveraged that process to scale from 200 machines
            to over 8,000 servers in AWS and GCP with no increase in head count.
          - > 
            During this time I dived deep into how search engines work. Even going so far as to 
            contribute some simple features to the [Tantivy](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy) library. This gave me a fundamental
            understanding of inverted indicies. Which removed another "magical" layer of how computers
            work.

            While at MAG, I worked with a distributed team located across the country
            to build a multi-tenant fulfillment layer on top of two different ERP
            systems allowing the heterogeneous environment of a $1 billion multi-divison
            company to transition to the new ERP as it made business sense.
          - >
            I choose this opportunity becaues it would allow me to reexplore the larger
            Enterprise Architecture concepts that only show up in large companies.
            Additionally, it would build on top of my fulfillment domain knowledge
            that I started with V23 Athletics and Amplifier. Lastly, I would
            have the pleasure of finally working with some [long](https://twitter.com/dahlbyk)

            I embarked on this journey to try and get a different perspective on the
            software development lifecycle. Being the one that has to make the large
            and sometimes boring decisions. How will that impact the company's bottom
            line? What all do we REALLY need? Its was a great process of exploring
            and understanding all aspects of running a business.

            I worked closely with a small team to produce and support Amplifier.com.
            My responsibilities include product feature work, support, and product analysis.
          - >
            I choose to take this job because I would be working on problems that involved
            the 'real' world. Amplifier ships products around the world and having actual
            people and physical plants involved in the process brings about new and unique
            challenges.

            UI work.
          - >
            I choose to take this job because of the team's reputation for a high commitment
            to software development quality, an intense focus on testing, and compositional
            programming. I was pushed to grow as a developer, and in return I was able to
            bring the architectural and people skills from my former position.

            I worked with the Enterprise Architect to plan and build over 90 different internal
            applications to support various business processes; including a data warehouse, various
            data retention plans, and several line of business applications. I supervised the code
            quality of 15 different developers to make sure our software principles were maintained
            while still meeting the business’ need for applications to be delivered. As a staff
            position I had to provide a business value reason for most of my recommendations,
            rather than direct edicts.

            I choose this job because I would be leading a team of developers in producing
            software that managed $56 billion in assets. While at the bank, I was pushed to
            explain technical concepts in terms that CXOs and VPs could understand, while at
            the same time making sure technical decisions were in lock step with the business’s
            long term goals.
