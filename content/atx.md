1. Austin is very proud of its BBQ. So if you like Texas BBQ (think
   Brisket) then that's a must do. Terry Blacks BBQ on Barton
   Springs La BBQ on Caesar Chavez Franklins (but that's a long
   multi-hour line - the two above are just as good) Oh, by my house is
   Moreno BBQ which is an upcoming rock star 
2. Night Life: The major
   nightlife is going to be 6th street and Rainey St. 6th street is
   divided into 3 sections (West 6th, Dirty, and East 6th). West is more
   clubby, Dirty is … well dirty - think the kinds of places you could
   sneak in under age - dollar shots - etc. East is the en vogue area and
   has more cocktails and hipster ish vibe. East 6th has my preferred
   cocktail bar called Whislers - and has an upstairs Mezcal bar. Across
   the street behind Lefty's is a dedicated Gin bar. East 6th also
   has my favorite “two-stepping bar” called White Horse that has Whiskey
   on tap as well. Rainey - is starting to fall out of my favor as it
   becomes condo heavy. But people still remember it as a cool place.
   There is a fun dive bar up on 11th called Nickel City that could be a
   fun post-music stop. since its in-between the two destinations. 
3. Nature: Number one is my heart is Barton Springs. If y'all
   brought swimming' suits and the weather is hot enough - I
   absolutely recommend a trip here. It's a natural spring fed pool
   that is 68 degrees year round. You go and bask in the texas heat, then
   take a dip in the chilly waters. It's a huge lay on the grass
   situation (No food or drinks allowed besides water to help keep pests
   out). After wards the move is to and get trashy food. This is a good
   recovery day. Options include Pool Burger, Matt's El Rancho, or
   if you are really feeling your college days going to Baby A's and
   getting shit housed on “Purps” (an ever clear based purple sugar
   “margarita”). 
   1. Also the Green Belt hikes are a strong move if you want
      to get between 1-4 miles of walking in surrounded by trees and if we
      have had enough water, some running water too. Plenty of entrances and
      google can help you. Also, the Town Lake trail - it's a 2-6 mile
      hike and bike trail around the “lake” in the center of the city. I say
      “lake” because it's damned up river. 😉 and it looks like a
      river. Tons of people will be out on the trail so it can be a fun
      time. 
4. Vibing with the College kids? … Austin is the Home to the
   University of Texas which has a huge campus and a neat vibe. If you
   want to walk around college kids or if you want to get some UT gear
   for a fan back home, I recommend going to the “Co Op” (a three story
   store dedicated to all things burnt orange) on Guadalupe. From there
   you can easily walk around check the scene. 
5. Food
   1. Now since you are used to
      really good beef, if you are looking for a good night out with high
      quality meat I would recommend Jacoby's on Caesar Chavez.
   2. If you
      want Sushi - I recommend Uchi, Fukumoto, or Neighborhood Sushi. 
   3. High
      End Mexican food: ATX Cocina Middle End Mexican Food: De Nada Cantina, 
      get the pink cup Margs but be warned…. If you want a solid Tex-Mex
      hit - Matt's El Rancho - the Knockout Margaritas and “The Bob”
      queso. Austin is also a huge fan of breakfast tacos. You can pretty
      much throw a rock and hit a place serving them. Brunch: Little 
      Darlin - near me - also good for dinners. A former motorcyclist bar taken
      over by hipsters (Yellow Jacket Social Club is the same kind of vibe)
      Paper Boy (upscale) - if you can get it - that place is busy AF Fresas
      on South 1st - strong mexican food location in a hip part of town.
      
6. Murals: Austin has a few murals - but the best one is to get a picture
   taken in front of the “I Love you So Much” mural on South Congress.
   Also, South Congress is a great place to park and walk up and down the
   street. Lot's of food options and people watching is A+.
   …pausing… let me know if I missed anything you were thinking of.
   Breweries: PHP (Pint House Pizza): Get the Electric Jellyfish (a hazy
   IPA that's all the rage) Meanwhile Brewery: A bit further East
   St. Elmo Brewery - in an up and coming little spot. Has a great food
   truck called Spicy Boys - It's also right next to Still Austin
   for local spirits. In the St. Elmo place is also a winery. Just down
   the “block” Groceries - near my house: 

1. Central Market - upscale HEB
   grocery store with a limited selection but great produce and an
   interesting “maze like” layout. Def not what you see every day. 
2. HEB
   - here is another thing that Texans will brag about until the cows
   come home. Their love of HEB. This is your one stop shop grocery store
   (Where CM will be missing odds and ends like not $1,000 toilet paper).
   This feels and looks like a normal store, they just tend to be a bit
   bigger and because we are in texas the produce is 💯 
3. Sprouts also
   close - hipster grocery - can be hit and miss on general items but if
   you need an organic GMO free, blessed by the fairies at night shaker
   of salt. They got you fam. Don't Do: I don't recommend the
   Randalls that is close to me.
