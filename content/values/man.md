title: 'First, be a Man'

    The creed of my fraternity, a statement I often revisit, to see how it "fits" me today.

> Primum, Vir Esto

This is the creed of my fraternity Zeta Chi. "Primum, Vir Esto" roughly translated as "First, be a Man". In the context of the late 90's early 2000's the "Vir" was assuredly meant to be the Masculine Hetero Male. As I've grown, I prefer to think of it as the archaic English form, which I interpret as "Human". 

> First, be human

Today I live this value, by trying to really see people. To connect with them as a human that is going through the same wild shit show that I am. Seeing many things for the first time. Feeling fragile, and acting robust.
