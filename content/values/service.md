> Be subject to one another out of reverence to Christ. "Be subject to one another." In this day and age of 24-hour cable crap, devoted to feeding the voyeuristic gluttony of the American public, hooked on a bad soap opera that's passing itself off as important, don't you think you might be able to find some relevance in verse 21? How do we end the cycle? Be subject to one another!
> Jed Bartlet from West Wing


I remember watching this scene. Shortly after it, he (Jed) runs into his Chief of Staff and asks him "Be subject to one another. What can I do to be of subject to you?" I recognize that this is fiction, but the idea of the American President asking his Chief of Staff "How can I be of service?" really hit me. It has stuck to me this day some years later. How can **I** help those around me.

Even if I am the leader of some group that I'm in. How can I help those around me. Those that would normally be supporting me.
