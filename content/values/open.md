    Sharing is Caring
---

A defining moment for me was finding Open Source Software. The idea that people would freely share
their knowledge and expertise with others was something novel. I came from a strong capatilistic mindset being 
a business student. This kind of sharing was completely novel.

This openness and sharing was an event that really changed the way that I thought of my own resources.

Another element, that occurs during this time is the emergence of the "Blog" and reading the book "Naked Conversations" around March 6, 2011.

Information wants to be free. We want to tell people things. Why restrict this?

I also tend to reflect on the story of Walt Disney and the Reporter (fake or real I love the idea)

> Walt Disney is supposed to be walking around rattling off ideas for Disney Land or some such.
> The reporter asks if Disney should really be sharing all of this with a reporter, and Mr. Disney
> turns at him and says "These are all today's ideas, the best are yet to come.
