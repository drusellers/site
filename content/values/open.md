A defining moment for me was finding Open Source Software. The idea that people would just freely share software that they had written with others. There was something about that, that really changed the way that I thought of my own resources.

Another element, that occurs during this time is the emergence of the "Blog" and reading the book "Naked Conversations" around March 6, 2011.
