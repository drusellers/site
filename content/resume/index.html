        I choose this opportunity because it would allow me to explore a position
        in a company's leadership. For years I've been reading books on business
        startegy and leadership. I will now be in the position to both exercise that
        knowledge and realize just how much I have to learn.
      - >
        This will also be my first job where .Net and Windows are not a core part
        of my every day life. This is both exciting and scary at the same time. I
        look forward to the onsault of learning.

        While at MAG, I worked with a distributed team located across the country
        to build a multi-tenant fulfillment layer on top of two different ERP
        systems allowing the heterogeneous environment of a $1 billion multi-divison
        company to transition to the new ERP as it made business sense.
      - >
        I choose this opportunity becaues it would allow me to reexplore the larger
        Enterprise Architecture concepts that only show up in large companies.
        Additionally, it would build on top of my fulfillment domain knowledge
        that I started with V23 Athletics and Amplifier. In addition, I would
        have the pleasure of finally working with some [long](https://twitter.com/dahlbyk)
        time [friends](https://twitter.com/TimBarcz).

      - I was part of a small team that built a small, local athletic apparel company.

        I embarked on this journey to try and get a different perspective on the
        software development lifecycle. Being the one that has to make the large
        and sometimes boring decisions. How will that impact the company's bottom
        line? What all do we REALLY need? Its was a great process of exploring
        and understanding all aspects of running a business.

        I worked closely with a small team to produce and support Amplifier.com.
        My responsibilities include product feature work, support, and product analysis.
      - >
        I choose to take this job because I would be working on problems that involved
        the 'real' world. Amplifier ships products around the world and having actual
        people and physical plants involved in the process brings about new and unique
        challenges.

        I worked closely with a small team to produce and support the Dovetail Employee
        Engagement Suite. My responsibilities included product feature work, mentoring
        staff, providing technical architecture direction, streamlining deployments and
        UI work.
      - >
        I choose to take this job because of the team's reputation for a high commitment
        to software development quality, an intense focus on testing, and compositional
        programming. I was pushed to grow as a developer, and in return I was able to
        bring the architectural and people skills from my former position.

        I worked with the Enterprise Architect to plan and build over 90 different internal
        applications to support various business processes; including a data warehouse, various
        data retention plans, and several line of business applications. I supervised the code
        quality of 15 different developers to make sure our software principles were maintained
        while still meeting the business’ need for applications to be delivered. As a staff
        position I had to provide a business value reason for most of my recommendations,
        rather than direct edicts.
      - >
        I choose this job because I would be leading a team of developers in producing
        software that managed $56 billion in assets. While at the bank, I was pushed to
        explain technical concepts in terms that CXOs and VPs could understand, while at
        the same time making sure technical decisions were in lock step with the business’s
        long term goals.
