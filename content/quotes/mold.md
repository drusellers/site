Put me into any mold and I’ll break it. Im not meant to be one way or another; black or white, fit or feminine, well behaved or chaotic. I’m all of these and a lot more. I believe there’s a lot more ladies in the world like me, the world just hasn’t seen what we’re made of yet. I’m working on changing that, are you?
