      <h2>Brand Introduction</h2>
      <p>Serious</p>
      <p>
        I tend to like <a href="https://simple.com">Simple.com's</a> brand.
        Clean whites with a bit of color
      </p>
      <p>Openness, Empathy, Experience, Emotion</p>
      <p>The balance of warm and cool - not just cool</p>
      <p>Balance Masculine images with feminine colors?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lotus Flower SVG</li>
        <li>Flat Irons SVG</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The balance of masculine and feminine is particularly interesting to me.
      </p>
      <h2>Words</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Tattoos - edgey</li>
        <li>Business - let's make money</li>
        <li>deadlifts - heavy, hard, big boy/girl shit</li>
        <li>code - intellect, thoughtfulness, optimization</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>Should feel like a scholarly article: mimic scholarly layouts.</p>
      <p>
        Should blend in some commerce: Use a guilloche pattern to bring in a
        variety of subtle colors. A guilloche pattern of 1's and 0's that's
        pretty fine like the idea of "micro-print" on currency. You have to
        "zoom" to some extent to see it. Its subtle, like weaving money and
        techology. I would love to have it in SVG so I would easily swap colors
        to fit with the brand.
      </p>
      <h1>1. Fonts</h1>
      <p>
        Headers: Helvetica - when i see this in bold headers it really feels
        like the standard white paper. I'm ok with that. I'll spend my "fun"
        elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>Body Copy: Helvetica - same, same</p>
      <h1>1. Colors</h1>
      <p>
        Blues / Blacks - Blue is a core part of the internet. Links are blue.
        While the OG blue is a bit too dark for me I want to maintain that
        history of blue links. So, blue should be an accent color in some ways
        at least.

      <p>But shouldn't shy away from Pinks</p>

      <p>
        Always like the idea of finding a way to work femine colors in. What is
        the femine version of serious? I feel like the blues of IBM, dark tones
        are what makes a manly color serious.

        How could you do a "Dark Mode" that wasn't black? Purples? Navy? Greens.
