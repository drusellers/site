      <p>
        This is the motto of my Alma Mater and my Fraternity and I have adopted
        it as my personal motto as well. I will strive always to act as the
        ideal of a Man. Someone who looks out for others and protects them. To
        judge a man in terms of being a human. To be compassionate and caring of
        others
