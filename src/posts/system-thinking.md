In the machine age we sought to understand a problem by breaking it down into smaller parts. But we have yet to find an end. Nor can we find a universal whole. Systems thinking/age requires us to understand the containing systems. Something the machine age overlooked. Also, synthesis.

Machine age saw a company as an autocracy which was lead by the "brain" or management. The system age respects that their are other players at play and can leverage other systems to acheive a better outcome. The complexity of organisations (of bright, monitvated people) makes autocratic management difficult.

## Organization vs Organism

Old: organism - brain, top-down, analysis
New: Organization - systems, synthesis

## Growth vs Development

Grow: bigger, not necessarily better
Develop: do more with less. "Punch above our weight"

* Machine Age vs System Age
* Organism vs Organization
* Analysis vs Synthesis
* Grow vs Develop

`money in = money out`

A healthy company is `money in < money out`

`f(mi) > mi` - where f is the function of labor (aka the biz)
`(f(mi) - mi) / mi` - measures the efficiency of the labor

By the very nature of the function of business "bugs" are an economic good. The represent learning over time.
