  I'm enamored with both iteration and long term planning. I don't
  see these things as mutually exclusive but how can we do it that
  doesn't drive us and our colleagues crazy?

While I was on my retreat I took some time to reread [Creating the Corporate Future](https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Corporate-Future-Plan-Planned/dp/0471090093). In the book they define the following words in the following ways.

- Ideals: those ends that are unattainable
- Objectives: ends we hope to obtain later
- Goals: ends we expect to obtain in the period

I like the presentation of these three different levels of planning. We can discuss and identify our ideals. These things that we will never acheive but drive us towards further success. We can always strive to be better people, having a terminous on such a thing seems silly. These ideals are the anchor to our downstream activities, do our objectives and goals push us toward our ideals or away from them.

Objectives, the large targets. These may take serveral periods to acheive, and that is ok. One of the "issues" I have with a highly iterative nature is that it can be very heads down. We need to be able to balance that level of focus with the ability to pick our heads up and chart a new course.

Goals, something that we can get done in a single period. At OMC we work in 6 week periods known as cycles. In this case its something that should be doable in 6 weeks.

If a cycle/period is 6 weeks long, then a goal should be complete in 6 weeks. An objective will require multiple cycles to complete. An ideal is never acheiveable.

Ok, so in addition to tracking the quarterly "anchor" forecasts we need to have other types of forecasts. Here I want to steal some terminology I first heard about in [Supertraining](https://www.amazon.com/Supertraining-Yuri-V-Verkhoshansky/dp/8890403810). Macro, meso, and micro training cycles. I like this as a projection of three different time horizons of planning. The micro cycle might be the quarterly forecast, the meso cycle could be the annual forecast, an the macro cycle could be the 5 year plan. Ideally I avoid abusing the metaphor but this seems to line up pretty well with basic tenants of business planning. I feel like I'm missing some kind of smaller unit, but I hesitate to introduce a nano unit. Ok, with this as a bit of foundation let's go ahead and carry on. [^1]

Ok, back to our ideals, objectives, and goals. Ideals are our macro level planning items. These are things that probably won't change all that often because they can never be acheived, they are things that we value and are a touch stone for us to come back to time and time again. We need to constantly revisit our macro level goals to make sure we are driving our smaller goals into the right directions. From there we have objectives, which are things we hope to obtain later. For this I like the kind of yearly time horizon. We will get them at some point, but it will take a couple of cycles in order to get there. Finally, we have our goals. Goals we will want to hit this period so these become our micro cycles. At my current job we focus our micro cycles in 6 week blocks of time. In my current fitness program a micro cycle is a week. _If I was to go full ludicrous we could say a nano-cycle is a single week, still not sold on it._

- talk about types of planning:
  - Inactivism: just manage what is going on right in front of my face
  - Reactivism: manage based on the past
  - Pre-actvisim: manage based on the future
  - Interactivism: manage based on all three based on need

```txt
            | Means | Goals | Objectives | Ideals |
operational |   o   |       |            |        | Inactivism
tatical     |   o   |   o   |            |        | Reactivism
strategic   |   o   |   o   |     o      |        | Pre-activism
normative   |   o   |   o   |     o      |   o    | Interactvism
```

Discontinuous Planning = a five year plan updated annually

- this is less awesome
  Continuous Planning - done 'all the time'
  Plan at all levels simultaneously - coordination
  Plan with all parts of the system - integration
  Coordination + Integration = Holistic

Page 74-75 - describes a process

[^1]: In a future post I end up redefining this a bit, but for the most part this is still accurate.
