While this was the creed of my fraternity "Primum, Vir Esto" First, be a Man, here Vir is a Masculine form I prefer to think of it instead as meaning the archaic English form of Man as in "Human"

Yet, I retain some of the Stoic attributes as well.

Represents the Stoic attributes

That I am "human"

Side note: males used to be called "Werman" hence man meaning all humans.
