Help me write a pithy one to two paragraph summary of the provided blog post for Linked In

## Context 

I am a senior engineering leader and systems architect with 25+ years of experience,
targeting Director of Engineering, Head of Engineering, Principal Engineer, or small-company
CTO roles at growth-stage product companies.

1. Focus on:
   - Engineering leadership and technical credibility
   - Systems thinking, architecture, and scaling
   - Improving teams, standards, and delivery reliability
   - Practical experience from real production environments
   - Business context as supporting background, not the main focus

2. Craft the message with the idea of talking to potential hiring managers, peers, and recruiters.
